Students in their fourth year at Cornell must have written and submitted an
external fellowship or grant proposal before their dissertation-year
fellowship is awarded.  The Graduate School maintains a [database of
doctoral fellowships](https://gradschool.cornell.edu/financial-support/fellowships/
external-fellowships/fellowship-resources-and-workshops/).


This session goes through some of the ways to write successful grants.

## Summary of Grant Proposal Advice

### Key Steps and Structure

1. **Identify the right funding agency or program** for your research. Tailor your proposal to the audience (private foundation, government agency, interdisciplinary, or economics-specific).
2. **Proposal structure:**
   - Introduction and Overview: What is your research about?
   - Why does it matter?
   - What is the state of the art in the field?
   - How do you innovate?
   - How does your innovation advance knowledge, society, or the funder's goals?
   - Timeline and plan for respecting it
   - How will success be assessed?

### Criteria for Evaluation (NSF)

- **Intellectual Merit:** Potential to advance knowledge.
- **Broader Impacts:** Potential to benefit society and achieve desired outcomes.
- Reviewers look for creative, original, or transformative concepts.

### Evidence to Provide

- Your expertise and qualifications
- Adequate resources and infrastructure
- Well-reasoned, organized, and sound rationale
- Mechanism to assess success

### Practical Advice

- Applying is required for certain fellowships (e.g., Sage fellowship at Cornell).
- A grant can provide additional resources for your research.
- Start preparing your proposal early (after passing your A-exam) to get feedback from your committee.
- Use writing resources offered by the Graduate School.
- Proposal writing is an important career skill and an opportunity to distinguish yourself.
