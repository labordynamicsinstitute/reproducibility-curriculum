## High-level Points

### Purpose of a Referee Report
- Help the editor decide on publication.
- Help authors improve their paper.

### First Steps When Invited
- Read the title and abstract to assess your expertise.
- Respond to the editor promptly.
- Disclose conflicts of interest or prior reviews immediately.
- Ensure you can meet the deadline (request extension if needed, but always try to meet it).

### Writing the Report
- Be constructive and avoid incendiary language.
- Provide a clear summary of the paper, including key insights and usefulness.
- Give the editor and authors a sense of what a careful reader takes away.
- Do not make a recommendation in the report itself; reserve that for the cover letter/editorial system.

#### Main Comments
- Address broad interest, innovation, and usefulness of findings.
- Assess appropriateness and correctness of the approach.
- Highlight non-negotiable shortcomings (e.g., data, assumptions, identification strategy).

#### Smaller Comments
- List items that are not deal-breakers but would improve the paper.
- Respect the authors' writing style; your job is not to rewrite the paper.
- Point out typos if you wish.

#### Ethics 
- Only suggest your own work if genuinely relevant.
- Be constructive and polite.

### Good Referee's Approach
- Take a developmental approach: identify problems and suggest ways to repair them.
- Aim to improve science and collective scholarship.
