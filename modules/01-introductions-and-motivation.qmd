## Some References to Illustrate Certain Problems

### Making up data

For kicks:

- <https://news.mit.edu/2015/how-three-mit-students-fooled-scientific-journals-0414>

Seriously:

- <https://datacolada.org/118>
- <https://datacolada.org/98>

2025:

- <https://economics.mit.edu/news/assuring-accurate-research-record>

Retracted:

- <https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aac6638>

and its data:

- <https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/100037/version/V8/view>

On a positive note: *Pre-registration*

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preregistration_(science)#cite_note-64>

But only if you add a PAP:

- <https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/730455>

But a PAP is really just an early reproducible template for your paper!
