- Using arbitrary code, LaTex, Git, and Overleaf
- Using integrated notebooks and what to do when your journal doesn't like Markdown (which is all of them) (Quarto, Jupyter notebooks with Stata)
- Method taught, vs. Lars' preferred method
- Examples with caveats - none of these are particularly focused on reproducible notebooks and how to integrate with articles that need to be submitted.
  - [Jupyter Notebooks](https://datacarpentry.github.io/python-ecology-lesson/jupyter_notebooks.html) (but focuses on Python)
  - [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)
